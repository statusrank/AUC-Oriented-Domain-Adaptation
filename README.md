# Code Clarification
This is an official code of our work AUCUDA. We implement this with PyTorch-v1.8 under the Python-v3.8 environment. Note that 'AUCDomainAdapation' in dalib/ours.py is AUCUDA proposed in this paper.

# About dataset 
Since the original open-source data is too large to upload, here we include each image's file path to ensure the reproduction of AUCUDA. Thus, before using this code, one should download the whole data from the website (URLs are included in the main paper) and then pick out the images by our provided image path file (see data/). 

# How to run?
Please refer to scripts/ where we present some examples to use this code.
